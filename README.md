# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

###Project Summary
Create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second and independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
